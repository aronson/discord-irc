# Changelog

This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## [2.9.0] - 2020-10-03

This release comes with a (relatively large) change to use discord.js v12!
There were a lot of breaking changes in the upstream library, including removal of support for Node <12, which prompted a 2.9.0-alpha release before this main version.
Everything seemed to go fine, which is why you're now receiving this latest update!

### Added

- IRC nick colors are now customizable in the config (thanks to [KWeaver87](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/pull/561))

### Changed

- Upgrade discord.js to 12.3.1 (the pre-release came with 12.2.0) - this changes a lot of how the bot works behind the scenes, and prepares us for upcoming Discord API changes - [#555](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/pull/555), [#564](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/pull/564)
- Add support for Node 14 ([#549](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/pull/549)); drop support for Node 6, 8 and 10 ([#550](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/pull/550))

### Fixed

- A bunch of vulnerabilities listed in `npm audit` are now gone - [#544](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/pull/544), [#548](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/pull/548), [#551](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/pull/551), [#552](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/pull/552), [#553](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/pull/553), [#562](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/pull/562)
- Log messages now typically take up one line again (fixing a relatively long-standing bug, at this point – oops!) - [#554](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/pull/554)
- Mentioning the same user more than once in a single message is now fixed (thanks to [Qyriad](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/pull/541))
- Our Discord client now uses a retry limit of 3 (rather than 1) on internal server errors (hopefully fixing [#461](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/issues/461)) - [#565](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/pull/565)

## [2.8.1] - 2020-03-16

- `parallelPingFix`, disabled by default, to prevent users of both Discord and IRC getting pings whenever their messages are mirrored to IRC (thanks to [qaisjp](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/pull/243) originally, follow up in [#502](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/pull/502) and [#520](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/pull/520))
- `ignoreUsers.discordIds`, to ignore specific Discord users through the bridge by ID instead of name (thanks to [nsavch](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/pull/508))
- A basic Docker image, found at [discordirc/discord-irc](https://hub.docker.com/r/discordirc/discord-irc)! This may not be often updated with the release tags we publish on GitHub, but it should contain a `latest` tag in addition to whichever Git hash is available on main (thanks to [gdude2002](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/pull/421), follow up in [#498](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/pull/498))

Webhooks lets you override nicknames and avatars, so messages coming from IRC
can appear as regular Discord messages:

![discord-webhook](http://i.imgur.com/lNeJIUI.jpg)

To enable webhooks, follow part 1 of [this
guide](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks)
to create and retrieve a webhook URL for a specific channel, then enable it in
discord-irc's config as follows:

```json
  "webhooks": {
    "#discord-channel": "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/id/token"
  }
```

## [2.4.0] - 2017-07-01

This project now uses [irc-upd](https://github.com/Throne3d/node-irc) as a dependency, instead of the old [irc](https://github.com/martynsmith/node-irc) package – this fork should be better maintained and will solve some bugs, detailed below.

### Added

- Allow commandCharacters to work for messages sent to Discord - [#221](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/pull/221).

- Send nick changes from IRC to Discord with `ircStatusNotices` - [#235](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/pull/235), [#241](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/pull/241).

- Translate custom emoji references from IRC to Discord - [#256](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/pull/256).

### Fixed

- Use `ircClient.nick` instead of `nickname` when checking if the `ircStatusNotices` event is for the bot, to prevent a potential crash - [#257](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/pull/257).

- Use the updated `irc-upd` library instead of `irc`, causing IRC messages to now be split by byte instead of character (fixing [#199](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/issues/199)) and adding support for certain Unicode characters in nicknames (fixing [#200](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/issues/200)) - [#258](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/pull/258).
